    "# Arrays vs Linked List Notes \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Memory Fundamentals\n",
    "To understand data structures, we must first understand how a computer stores data.\n",
    "* **The Request:** When you store an item, you ask the computer for space. It provides a specific **Memory Address** (e.g., `0xfe0ffeeb`).\n",
    "* **Memory Layout:** Think of memory as a giant grid of slots. Some slots might be empty, while others are already occupied by other programs (the \"memory land mines\").\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Sequential vs. Distributed Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Arrays (Contiguous Storage)**\n",
    "In an array, all elements are stored **right next to each other** in memory.\n",
    "* **The Movie Theater Analogy:** You and 4 friends find a row with 4 empty seats. If a 5th friend (John’s girlfriend) joins, and the seats on either side are taken, the *entire group* must move to a new row that can fit 5 people.\n",
    "* **Pre-allocation (The \"Fix\"):** To avoid moving, you can \"hold\" 10 seats just in case. However, if only 5 people show up, those extra 5 seats are **wasted memory**. If an 11th person arrives, you still have to move the whole group.\n",
    "* **Access Type:** **Random Access.** Because elements are contiguous (right next to one another), if you know the address of the first element, you can mathematically calculate the address of the $i$-th element instantly. This makes reading $O(1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Linked Lists (Distributed Storage)**\n",
    "In a Linked List, items can be scattered anywhere in memory. Each item stores the **data** and a **pointer** (the address of the next item).\n",
    "[Image of a linked list in memory with pointers connecting nodes]\n",
    "* **The Treasure Hunt Analogy:** To find your friends, you go to the first friend's house. They give you a note with the address of the second friend. You must visit them in order to find the last person.\n",
    "* **Access Type:** **Sequential Access.** You cannot jump to the middle; you must start at the head and follow the pointers. This makes reading $O(n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Performance Comparison (Big $O$ Notation)\n",
    "\n",
    "| Operation | Array | Linked List | Note |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **Read** | $O(1)$ | $O(n)$ | Arrays use \"Random Access\"; Lists must traverse pointers. |\n",
    "| **Insert** | $O(n)$ | $O(1)$ | Arrays may require shifting; Lists just update pointers. |\n",
    "| **Delete** | $O(n)$ | $O(1)$ | Arrays require shifting elements to fill the gap. |\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: In practice, \"Insert\" for a Linked List is $O(1)$ only if you already have the pointer to that specific location.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Key Trade-offs\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why Arrays are Popular**\n",
    "1. **Random Access:** Essential for algorithms like **Binary Search**.\n",
    "2. **Caching:** CPUs are designed to read contiguous memory very quickly (spatial locality). It \"pre-fetches\" the next items in an array, making sequential reads in an array much faster than jumping around a linked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why Linked Lists are Useful**\n",
    "1. **Dynamic Size:** You don't need to know the size upfront or pre-allocate memory.\n",
    "2. **No \"Moving\" Costs:** If you are constantly adding/removing items (like a task queue), you never worry about the \"moving the whole group to a new row\" penalty.\n",
    "3. **Memory Overhead:** A pointer takes up space. If your data is tiny (like a single character), the pointer might double the memory usage. If your data is huge (like a video file), the pointer's size is negligible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Hybrid Approach: Array of Linked Lists**\n",
    "This is a common way to build **Hash Tables**. You get a fixed number of \"slots\" (Array) for speed, and if multiple items land in one slot, you chain them together (Linked List). This attempts to balance the search speed of arrays with the insertion flexibility of lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Selection Sort\n",
    "Selection Sort is a basic sorting algorithm that relies on repeatedly finding the minimum element from an unsorted list and moving it to the front.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Complexity:** $O(n^2)$ (Quadratic time).\n",
    "* **The Logic:** 1. You have to check $n$ elements to find the smallest.\n",
    "    2. You have to repeat this process $n$ times to sort the whole list.\n",
    "* **Big $O$ and Constants:** As $n$ grows toward infinity, the \"type\" of growth (quadratic) completely overwhelms any small multipliers (like $1/2$). This is why we ignore constants and focus on the power of $n$.\n",
